##How To Obtain The Source Code
To get the source code for ACalendar, visit [this link to our github page](https://cse403deatheaters.github.io/cse403-16au-ACal/productSite.html). For direct access to our repository, visit [this link](https://github.com/CSE403DEATHEATERS/cse403-16au-ACal.git). 

For more information on how to use Github, visit [this link](https://help.github.com/).

##Directory Structure

##How To Test ACalendar
Since ACalendar database are stored in Amazon Web Services (AWS), developers need to use AWS Lambda functions in Eclipse by using the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse. The AWS Toolkit for Eclipse Lambda Plugin provides a feature in which a JUnit test class is created automatically upon creation of a new AWS Lambda Java project. Lambda is a fully managed compute service that runs developers code in response to events generated by custom code. Developers need to create a Lambda handler class by the following step in Eclipse toolbar:

1. On the Eclipse toolbar, open the drop-down Amazon Web Services menu (identified by the AWS icon) and select New AWS Lambda Java project...
2. Add your Java project name, package name, and class name in the associated input boxes. You can choose any valid names that you want. While you type, the code in the Source preview will change to reflect the changes you make in the dialog.
3. For Input Type, choose Custom.
4. The second Input Type field is name of the actual Java type that will be returned, which must be a Java class (not a primitive type such as `float`, `int` or `boolean`). It defaults to `Object`. Change this value to `String`.
5. Change the value of Output Type to `String`, as well.
6. Verify that your entries look like the following screenshot (modify them if they are not), and then click Finish.

Finally, you can implement you handler function and start testing you program.


##Known Bugs List
Developers need to post discover bugs that they have been found on GitHub. They can create an issue by:

1. Open GitHub on webpage, then click on “create issue”
2. Give a title about the issue and provide little more description of the issue on the comment block.  (Note: by adding @username on the comment block, a message would send to the user)
3. Choose labels on the right of the comment block and click finish.

Then you chick the issues on bar the right-hand side of the webpage, you can see all the issues that have been post.

##Build Automation with Travis CI
Add `.travis.yml` file to root directory of the repository. Travis CI will build the project at every push and pull request. If build fails, the develop team will be notified by email.

##Daily Automation Builds with Cron

1. Configure email sending on mac: follow [this guide](http://www.developerfiles.com/how-to-send-emails-from-localhost-mac-os-x-el-capitan/)
2. Add a cronjob though the terminal:

	```
	crontab -e
    ```
    
3. This should open the editor, so add:

	```
	MAILTO=”your_email”
	*/10 23 * * * <path to ci.sh> <base_directory> <name_of_tmp_directory> <path_to_android_sdk>
    ```
with one empty line at the end of the file.

4. Format of cronjob configuration file follow [this guide](http://www.nncron.ru/help/EN/working/cron-format.htm)

##Releasing A New Version

* ###Client Side
After an updated version of the client is built and tested, it is recommended to use Gradle to generate the compiled APK file. Then the project should be pushed from local repository to the `master` branch on our repository([https://github.com/CSE403DEATHEATERS/cse403-16au-ACal](https://github.com/CSE403DEATHEATERS/cse403-16au-ACal)).

* ###Server Side
After server side codes are updated and tested, you should push it to our repository and contact us through `Acal_techteam@u.washington.edu`, and we will deploy the updated version for you.

###Download links for .apk, .tar.gz, .zip files:

* _.apk file:_ [https://github.com/CSE403DEATHEATERS/cse403-16au-ACal/tree/master/app/build/outputs/apk/app-release-unsigned.apk?raw=true](https://github.com/CSE403DEATHEATERS/cse403-16au-ACal/tree/master/app/build/outputs/apk/app-release-unsigned.apk?raw=true)
* _.zip file:_ [https://github.com/CSE403DEATHEATERS/cse403-16au-ACal/zipball/master](https://github.com/CSE403DEATHEATERS/cse403-16au-ACal/zipball/master)
* _.tar.gz file:_ [https://github.com/CSE403DEATHEATERS/cse403-16au-ACal/tarball/master](https://github.com/CSE403DEATHEATERS/cse403-16au-ACal/tarball/master)

###Update Product Website

The [Product Website](https://cse403deatheaters.github.io/cse403-16au-ACal/productSite.html) is store under the `gh-pages` branch of the project repository. To add the download links to the website, open productSite.html and modify the href attribute of the corresponding download links.

##How To Build ACalendar
The application is built using the integrated build system [Gradle](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio-build.html) of Android Studio. 
Normally, Gradle will automatically build the project after it is opened in Android Studio. To manually do this, click on the “Build” option in the menu bar, and then choose “Rebuild project”.

Other options, such as making the project and generating the APK package, could also be accessed under this menu.

You can also use the command line. On the root of the project you can run

	./gradlew assembleDebug

Which will build the project in debug mode. You can also run

	./gradlew clean

To remove any files created from the build. 
See [this link](http://developer.android.com/tools/building/building-cmdline.html) for more information on building on the command line.
